## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Generate an OAuth2 project. ( https://code.google.com/apis/console/ )

From the services tab, activate the following:

  - "Google Apps Reseller API"
  - "Admin SDK"
  -  "Site Verification API"

Add a new API Client ID from the console:

  - Select the service account mechanism
  - Download the p12 private key.

Convert the P12 key into PEM format:
    
    openssl pkcs12 -in xxxxx.p12 -nodes -nocerts > privatekey.pem

Adjust 'settings.py' to reflect the API Client ID, Service Account Email Address, and private key location.

Authorize the Client ID in the Google Apps Control Panel for the reseller domain.
  ( Security -> Advanced Settings -> Manage Third Party OAuth )

For the client name, utilize the Client ID from the API project.

Add the following scopes:
  -  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.order
  -  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/siteverification
  -  https://apps-apis.google.com/a/feeds/user/
  -  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user
